Learning how to make and work with a child theme in WordPress
Since I am using WP Engine and it has its own special Git Deploy this repo may not have been necessary.  
However I don't trust anything or myself not lose changes and files so I will still be using this repo.  After all its just another push from my local Git bash
and a little extra peace of mind.
